  - StatisticsResult: Constructed decomposition of program
    Your program was decomposed into 10 terminating modules (10 trivial, 0 deterministic, 0 nondeterministic). 10 modules have a trivial ranking function, the largest among these consists of 38 locations.
  - StatisticsResult: Timing statistics
    BüchiAutomizer plugin needed 373.0s and 11 iterations.  TraceHistogramMax:1. Analysis of lassos took 18.0s. Construction of modules took 156.6s. Büchi inclusion checks took 196.3s. Highest rank in rank-based complementation 0. Minimization of det autom 10. Minimization of nondet autom 0. Automata minimization 1.0s AutomataMinimizationTime, 9 MinimizatonAttempts, 13571 StatesRemovedByMinimization, 9 NontrivialMinimizations. Non-live state removal took 0.5s Buchi closure took 0.0s. Biggest automaton had -1 states and ocurred in iteration -1. Nontrivial modules had stage [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

  - StatisticsResult: Constructed decomposition of program
    Your program was decomposed into 6 terminating modules (6 trivial, 0 deterministic, 0 nondeterministic). 6 modules have a trivial ranking function, the largest among these consists of 16 locations.
  - StatisticsResult: Timing statistics
    BüchiAutomizer plugin needed 15.3s and 7 iterations.  TraceHistogramMax:1. Analysis of lassos took 3.4s. Construction of modules took 7.5s. Büchi inclusion checks took 4.0s.

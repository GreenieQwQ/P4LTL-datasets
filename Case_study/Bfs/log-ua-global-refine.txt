  - StatisticsResult: Constructed decomposition of program
    Your program was decomposed into 8 terminating modules (8 trivial, 0 deterministic, 0 nondeterministic). 8 modules have a trivial ranking function, the largest among these consists of 13 locations.
  - StatisticsResult: Timing statistics
    BüchiAutomizer plugin needed 35.0s and 9 iterations.  TraceHistogramMax:1. Analysis of lassos took 5.6s. Construction of modules took 21.4s. Büchi inclusion checks took 7.1s.
